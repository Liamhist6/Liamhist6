- 👋 Hi, I’m Yves Amoros
- 👀 I’m interested in marine habitat mapping and marine ecology 
- 🌱 I’m currently Learning Modelling environmental variables to predict the spatial distribution of coral communities in the future
- 🌱 I'm currently Learning how to build model DinoV2 to predict benthic class on underwater images to predict the spatial distribution of coral communities and to map habitat (Coral bed, seagrass, algae,...)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Someone who can help me with this modelling so that I can predict this distribution 
- 📫 How to reach me yvesamoros6@gmail.com
